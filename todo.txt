- Should add options for file open: FILE_APPEND, FILE_TRUNCATE
Which will decide where to place write pointer, if it needed to append file 
e.g. write from end of file (get it from file size) or write from beginning.
If decided to write from beginning of file - clear file size, collapse cluster chain, make sure that initial cache of file is clear
